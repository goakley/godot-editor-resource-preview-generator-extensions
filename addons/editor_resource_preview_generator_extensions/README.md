# EditorResourcePreviewGenerator Extensions

A Godot 4 plugin that extends the functionality of [`EditorResourcePreviewGenerator`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_editorresourcepreviewgenerator.html) to simplify preview generation.
Fully compatible with Godot's existing [`EditorResourcePreview`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_editorresourcepreview.html) functionality.

The plugin currently provides the following features:

* An `EditorResourcePreviewGenerator2D` class that allows for generating previews using [`CanvasItem`-style drawing calls](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/2d/custom_drawing_in_2d.html).

Basic examples can be found in the built-in documentation for the plugin's classes.
Full runnable examples can be found in the `addons/` directory.
